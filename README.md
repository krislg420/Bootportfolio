Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 


## Directions

First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to recreate your portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

* Create the following pages: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

                              
                                        
                                        
## USER STORY



 Hello!! May name is Christopher Garcia.I was given a great opportunity and decided to change my life by making a career change. Even though now that I have learned and continue to learn this wizardry I need away to show you what I can do. So I made a.... you guessed it a Portfolio. So please make way to my portfolio and check out some of the projects Ive been working on.  



### Hints

* Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

* On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.
